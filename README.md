# Red Alert .5

Red Alert .5 is an OpenRA mod aiming to have a campaign acting around 1936 to start of Red Alert 1 (early 50s) and show what happened during this time in Red Alert universe.

Mod contains 6 factions with total 29 subfactions, but with minimal faction differences like in Dune 2000. Current plan is to give each faction 3 and each subfaction an additional unit per subfaction.

Mod is currently in pretty early stage, i haven't even decided what exactly to give to each (sub)faction. No missions are done yet.

# Installation
